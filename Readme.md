How to test that

Use the simplex method to solve the following LP problem. 
Maximize Z = 3x1 + 5x2 + 4x3 
Subject to the constraints 
(i) 2x1 + 3x2 ≤ 8, 
(ii) 2x2 + 5x3 ≤ 10, 
(iii) 3x1 + 2x2 + 4x3 ≤ 15 
and x1, x2, x3 ≥ 0
Input such as:
6
3,5,4,0,0,0
[2,3,0,1,0,0] =>8
[0,2,5,0,1,0]=>15
[3,2,4,0,0,1]=>10
